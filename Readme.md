#Hazard Hills
A LDJam entry for Ludum Dare #31

Hazard Hills is my first ever Ludum Dare game!  It's a bit unpolished as I ran out of time to finish it, but the gameplay is there and it's decently fun.  I'm planning on working on this after Ludum Dare is over as well, so expect to see some updates post-LDJam.

Gameplay is like a somewhat simplified Donkey Kong, featuring snowballs instead of barrels and a bean instead of Mario.

Was pretty much 100% solo, except for the music which was done by one of my team-mates.

Made in Unity's basic version, not Unity Pro.

Fonts in use: Smudger LET, Scruff LET, and Victorian LET, these are all used for my fancy Flameflake Games logo.
